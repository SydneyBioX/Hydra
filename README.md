# Interpretable deep generative ensemble learning for single-cell omics with Hydra

Thank you for using Hydra, if you find a bug or encounter any issues running the tool, please open an issue on GitHub, and we will get back to you as soon as possible!!

Single-cell omics technologies enable the dissection of cellular heterogeneity, yet the high dimensionality, inherent noise, and sparsity present significant analytical challenges. As the technologies evolve to measure multiple molecular features, such as chromatin accessibility and surface protein expression, they introduce additional complexity to the integrative analysis of multimodal single-cell omics data. Here, we propose Hydra, a deep generative framework based on an ensemble of variational autoencoders for effective utilization of diverse unimodal and multimodal single-cell omics data. Hydra implements interpretable learning modules for capturing cell type-specific molecular signatures. The ensemble of such interpretable modules improves feature selection reproducibility and robust annotation of cell types in query datasets.
